        Makes un-pickle-able objects pick-able.
        
        ## Install
        
        You can install it via pip
        
        ```
        pip install pickle-mixin
        ```
        
        ## Running the tests
        
        After installation, you can test it
        ```
        python -c "import pickle_mixin; pickle_mixin.test()"
        ```
        as long as you have [pytest](http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Pickle by initialisation
        
        Suppose that you have a class whose objects are un-pickle-able or that would
        demand a large amount of disk space or memory to be pickle-able.
        ``PickleByInit`` class lets you pickle object attributes via object
        initialization.
        Consider the following classes:
        ```python
        class Foo(PickleByInit):
            def __init__(self, obj):
                super(Foo, self).__init__()
                self.obj = obj
        
        class Bar(object):
            def __init__(self, filename):
                self.filename = filename
        
            def __getstate__(self):
                raise PicklingError
        
            def init_dict(self):
                return dict(filename=self.filename)
        ```
        Trying to pickle as follows
        ```python
        f = Foo(Bar('file.txt'))
        pickle.dumps(f)
        ```
        would raise a ``PicklingError``.
        The following on the other hand would work:
        ```python
        f = Foo(Bar('file.txt'))
        f.set_signature_only_attr('obj')
        pickle.dumps(f)
        ```
        The un-pickling process of ``f.obj`` attribute happens via object
        initialisation, passing the returned dictionary from ``init_dict``
        as keyword arguments to ``Bar.__init__``.
        
        ### Mixing classes with and without slots
        
        Pickling does not save attributes defined via ``__slots__`` in the following
        case:
        ```python
        class Foo(object):
            __slots__ = ['a']
        
            def __init__(self):
                self.a = 4
        
        
        class Bar(Foo):
            def __init__(self):
                pass
        ```
        
        ``SlotPickleMixin`` fixes it:
        ```python
        class FooMixin(object):
            __slots__ = ['a']
        
            def __init__(self):
                self.a = 4
        
        
        class BarMixin(FooMixin, SlotPickleMixin):
            def __init__(self):
                FooMixin.__init__(self)
                SlotPickleMixin.__init__(self)
        
        f = BarMixin()
        o = pickle.dumps(f)
        f = pickle.loads(o)
        assert hasattr(f, 'a')
        ```
